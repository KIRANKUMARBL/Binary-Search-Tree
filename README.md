Hereâ€™s a **README.md** content for your Binary Search Tree program:

# Binary Search Tree (BST) in Java

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in Java.
It supports **insertion** of nodes and **in-order traversal** for printing values in sorted order.

## âœ¨ Features

* Insert elements into a BST
* Print elements using **in-order traversal** (sorted order)
* Dynamic tree creation

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

```
BST.java      # Main program containing Node and BST class
```

## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. **Insert:** Elements are inserted according to BST rules:

   * Values smaller than the current node go to the **left**.
   * Values greater go to the **right**.
2. **Traverse:** In-order traversal is used to print sorted values.

## ðŸ’» Example Output

### Input:

```
50, 30, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80
```

### Output:

```
20 30 40 50 60 70 80
```

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Save the code in a file named `BST.java`.
2. Compile:

   ```bash
   javac BST.java
   ```
3. Run:

   ```bash
   java BST
   ```

## ðŸ“– Notes

* This code currently supports **insertion** and **in-order traversal**.
* Search and delete operations can be added for full BST functionality.

If you want, I can extend this README with **search and delete method details** so it looks like a complete BST package.
